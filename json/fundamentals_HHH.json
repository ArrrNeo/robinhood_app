        "description": "Howard Hughes Holdings Inc. is a holding company. It operates through the following segments: Operating Assets, MPCs, Strategic Developments, and Seaport. The MPC segment is involved in the horizontal development of residential land and selling the improved acreage to homebuilders for the eventual sale of homes to new residents. The Strategic Developments segment focuses on building commercial properties at the appropriate time using the cash flow harvested from the sale of land to homebuilders which helps mitigate development risk. The Seaport segment includes a few multiblock districts largely under private management by a single owner and is being revitalized and enhanced into a mixed-use neighborhood featuring unique culinary and entertainment offerings. The company was founded on June 9, 2023 and is headquartered in The Woodlands, TX.",
