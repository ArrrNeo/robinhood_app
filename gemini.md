This project contains two main parts:

1. An older Streamlit-based application located in the root directory.
2. A newer React-based application, with its code in the `frontend` and `backend` directories. This is an ongoing effort to modernize the project.
3. Do not change unnecessary code. (like, moving code to previous line without logical change, removing still relavent comments, removing empty lines etc)
4. do not start backend or frontend server. my frontend and backend servers are auto-reload
5. for any editing focus only on frontend/backend of react based application
